# WSLControl

An application to control settings and other features of WSL overall and of separate instances. Mostly feature-complete, but can be buggy. The only big thing missing at the moment is physical drive pass-through.

To use distro settings companion.pl must be copied inside of the home folder of your default user and renamed .companion.pl
